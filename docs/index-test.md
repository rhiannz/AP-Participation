# Exploratory Data Analysis 

### Correlation Matrix of our Cleaned Dataset 

![completed_correlation](../../assets/images/completed_correlation.png)

(Note: `AP_oneormore_relative` is the percent of students who took one or more AP Exam while `students_AP_exam_oneormore` is the number of student who took one or more AP Exam ) 


Here we can see the correlation matrix of our completed data. We can see how AP Exam Participation (denoted as AP_oneormore_relative) is most positively correlated with other AP related features, such as as enrollment in AP courses, which makes sense intuitively. AP Exam participation is also positively correlated with enrollment in the gifted/talented programs and SAT/ACT participation, which we should expect as well since students who take AP Exams are likely to take other tests and be a part of other academically rigorous programs. AP Exam participation is negatively correlated with features concerning student suspensions and absenteeism. This is something we should also expect, as schools with higher rates of student misconduct will likely have lower academic performance. We should also note that AP Exam participation is most strongly correlated with Asian student population, which we will be exploring next. 



### AP Exam Participation Percentages by Race and Year

Above, we can see the average AP Exam participation rates by race and year. Most notably, Asian students have the highest AP Exam participation rates, by far. However, when looking at the rest of the student body, there are rather similar partipation rates. We should also note that there is a general increase in exam participation throughout the years. 

### School Population by Race and Year

After observing the exam particpation rates, we explored the school populations by race and year as well. Now comparing these two bar charts, we can see the drastic differences between the exam particpation and student population. We can see how student population is not nearly as evenly distributed across race as the exam particpation was. Additionally, 
We first got a quick glance at the overall demographics of our schools across the years. We can see how there is an ???
