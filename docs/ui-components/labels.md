# Random Forest Modeling 


We saw in the previous section that our linear regression model failed to perform very well. Thus, we decided to explore the usage of a Random Forest Regression in order to try to determine which variables in our model explain AP Exam Enrollment the most. This was done because Random Forest Modeling can be used to account for non-linear relationships between our predictors and response. 

We first ran our random forest with the default parameters, but we found that our model was overfitting quite a bit giving us a testing RÂ² of 0.7 and a training value of around 0.3. So, in order to reduce overfitting we used 10 fold cross-validation with a grid search to determine the optimal parameters that should be used in our random forest regression. We used the negative mean squared error in order to determine the accuracy of our models. Our results from this cross validation grid search were the following:

Here we see that even with cross validation and the grid search our model is unfortunetly overfitting. We then attempted to try using gradient boosting trees, but we were unable to make the accuracy of the model increase. We have decided to attribute this issue to our data and the possibiility that we have not included the best predictors to help predict AP Exam Enrollment in different areas. 

In the image below the red line represents the actual y value and the blue line represents the predicted y value. The x-axis is the y value that is being estimated from the model using a fixed effect.

Here we see that the model is having a hard time account for the variation on the left and right side, causing there to be a large amount of values to be estimated as zero, or exactly the mean. 

Even though this model performs poorly when trying to predict for a new area, we can say that these features (in the image below) accurately explain the high AP Exam Enrollment in 1/3 of the schools in California.
