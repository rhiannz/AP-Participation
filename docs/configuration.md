# Data Collection & Cleaning 

## Data Collection 

We began by collecting our data from the Urban Institute Education Data Portal. Their goal is to compile a multitude of different datasets from different schools, school districts, and colleges and have them available in one spot. Since our goal for this project  was to analyze which factors influence AP Exam Enrollment we looked at data for specific schools in California. We gathered 9 different datasets from the National Center for Education Statisticsâ€™ Common Core of Data (CCD) and from the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The different datasets that we read in were on the following topics:

- AP Exams  (specifically looking at students who took one of more AP Exam) 
- School Directory
- School Enrollment  
- Discipline 
- Chronic Absentee 
- SAT & ACT Participation 
- Teachers and Staff
- School Finance 
- AP, IB, and GT Enrollment 

Our main focus was on the table that contained AP Examination data as this is our main variable in question. With the other 8 datasets we had a total of 40 different variables once they where compiled together.

Then after imputing some missing observations and dropping repetitive columns, we created ended up with a nice, clean dataframe, as seen below.
