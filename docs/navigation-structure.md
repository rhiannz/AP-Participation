# Exploratory Data Analysis with Maps

### AP Exam Enrollment vs. Different Demographics 

With the many predictors that we had we wanted to do some exploratory data analysis while also looking at the locations of the schools. As seen in the previous section, there is some interesting insight as to which demographics tend to take AP Exams more frequently than others.  

For our first set of maps we display below, we wanted to depict the percentage of AP Exams taken at each school relative to the percentage of different races at that school. Thus, in the following maps the color of the dot corresponds to the percentage of students that took AP Examinations. A darker color means more students at those schools took AP Exams. The size of the dot corresponds to the percentage of different races at those schools. Below we picked 4 different demographics to be displayed: White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian. It should also be noted that these maps represent our data for the year 2011 only. This was done because the trends between the years tend to be quite similar.

Here we can see that both the Black and Asian population tend to cluster in the more populated city areas, were as both the Hispanic and White population are spread throughout most of California. There doesn't seem to be an apparent trend both the maps depicting White and Black students. That being said, in the maps that displays both the Asian and Hispanic population it seems like The darker color dots are more apparent due to them having a larger size. This could make one think that in schools with a large Asian and Hispanic population they have a large AP exam participation.
