# Conclusion 

Now, looking at the results of our models, we can provide policy makers more insight as to what school characteristics best explain AP Exam participation. From our linear model, we may suggest that policy makers focus on 

Therefore, out of the available school characteristics that we have considered, ??? are able to most explain the AP Exam participation rate. 

TEACHER SALARY: 
Policy makers should also advocate for higher teacher salaries as well, since this corresponds to a lower teacher turn over rate and teachers with more work experience which leads to a higher quality learning experience and higher student achievement<sup>[https://journalistsresource.org/education/school-teacher-pay-research/]</sup>. 




CONFOUNDING VARIABLES:
Of course, there also many other confounding variables that we were unable to take into acccount, such as the individual student's emotional wellbeing, home life, or indiviudal socio-economic status, that may also be a big factor in determining AP Exam participation.  


BETTER DATA: 
We also suspect that our findings may have been largely affected by the numerous discrepancies and missing values within our data. In order to properly investigate the nuances of the current academic landscape, we would also urge policy makers to advocate for the collection of more accurate and robust data. 

RACE: 
Since race was included in one of our final explanatory variables, policy makers should focus on creating race-conscious education goals that are designed to explicity discuss race, consider racial achievement gaps, and provide equitable support as opposed to composing race-neutral plans and proposals. 

ENRL_AP: 
Naturally, policy makers should focus not only encouring participation in AP Exams but work towards increasing enrollment in other academically rigorous programs and activities as well. 

ABSENTEEISM: 
Policy makers should certainly aim more attention towards decreasing chronic absenteeism and promoting school rentention since we found this to be a crucial factor in explaining AP Exam participation as well. 


Conclusion: 
Of course, there is always room for improvement and researchers are still struggling to properly explain __ and determine policies that will amelorate __ 

We hope that future research will allow all student the right support and resources they need to reach their goals.
